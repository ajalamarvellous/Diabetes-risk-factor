# Diabetes-risk-factor
This project seeks to use Machine Learning to predict whether as patient has an undiagnosed diabetes

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset]

The dataset has 17 features with following attributes

Age 1.20-65
Sex 1. Male, 2.Female
Polyuria 1.Yes, 2.No.
Polydipsia 1.Yes, 2.No.
sudden weight loss 1.Yes, 2.No.
weakness 1.Yes, 2.No.
Polyphagia 1.Yes, 2.No.
Genital thrush 1.Yes, 2.No.
visual blurring 1.Yes, 2.No.
Itching 1.Yes, 2.No.
Irritability 1.Yes, 2.No.
delayed healing 1.Yes, 2.No.
partial paresis 1.Yes, 2.No.
muscle stiness 1.Yes, 2.No.
Alopecia 1.Yes, 2.No.
Obesity 1.Yes, 2.No.
Class 1.Positive, 2. Negative

With 520 attributes

The problem is a simple classification problem with the last feature "class" used as the target class

Various machine learning algorithms were employed including Logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision tree with the best being with highest accuracy being Logistics regression with a margin "C" attribute of 1
